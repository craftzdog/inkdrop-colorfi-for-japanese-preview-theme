## Theming code blocks

Highlighting code blocks is built with [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/demo/theme.html), and CSS selectors for styling code blocks are compatible with it.
CSS selectors always start with `cm-`.
You can easily import styles from [CodeMirror's theme](https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/tree/master/theme).
